Twitch chat integration game ideas w/matt

base ideas:
-team of two for scalability
-opt in to join via command (on screen VISIBLE prompts)
-Leaderboard/highscores

-communal vote game (ie. black jack (aka 21) voting on stay, split, whatever you do in black jack)

1.Highest number (not a great idea)
2.Black Jack
3.QBERT

GOOD STARTER IDEA:
	Binary Choice Needle (Yes or no prompt)
		-Needle goes towards "yes" side if chat types "yes", and vice versa for no
	
	How it should work:
		-it should be an application that I can open whenever I would like to ask a question that has chat decision impact
		
		-it takes in chatroom commands based on the prompt (in the base case users should input "yes" or "no")
		
		-afer the the decision has been made (based on either timer, or pushing a button to end the decision making time)
		there should be some fan fare(big yes or big no appears over the choice thing) to indicate which choice was made
			-fanfare should include sound like to indicate that it's over
			
		-it should close on a button input and reset ready to be open again later (or just x out i guess :thinking:)
		(ex: During a stream you ask your audience: "Should I buy *insert game name here*" then the people in the chatroom say yes or no
			depending on what they want, then at the end "yes" wins)
			
	Possible implementations:
		Prompt for streamer to enter the choice options(could be a window prompt with input choices for "choice 1" and "choice 2")
			-allows for modifying without opening the code
		Possibly implement timer
			-allows for it to go on in the background and complete on its own (if prompt window is used, timer could be an optional check box
				and prompt for amount of time in seconds)
				
	Main Purpose:
		-provides an enhanced sense of interactivity by creating a visualization for group decision making
		
		Secondary purposes:
			-to learn how to implement chatroom integration into a game/program
			-learn how to make useful applications as a group by means of a personal project
	
	What we need:
		1.What do we use to program it?
			1.Options include:
				1.C++
					pros:
						-both of our first programming language, therefore comfort pick
						-alexis has worked with graphics in c++ before
					cons:
						-alexis did not like the graphics library setup for c++ in his past experience
				2.C#(Unity)
					pros:
						-built in graphical stuff/3d model stuff
						-meant for making games
					cons:
						-could be overkill for type of game we are planning to make
						-would require both matt and alexis to learn c# better
				3.Java
					pros:
						-.net is in java I believe, and might be used for chat integration
						-java is efficient and widely used/flexible for Operating systems
					cons:
						-alexis doesnt know it very well (should learn it though anyways so maybe this is a pro)
				4.Python (probably not, but maybe I guess)
					pros:
						-easy to use modules for graphics
						-easy language to learn quickly
					cons:
						-matt would need to learn it, and I haven't used it too much
						-less flexible/efficient (but it would suffice for this typ of thing I believe)
						
					
		2.Learn how to get twitch chat and read it:
			1.Find youtube videos/guides on how to read chat in a program and use it for input
				IRC TO READ CHAT
